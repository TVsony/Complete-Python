    "#### Polymorphism in Python\n",
    "- Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different types to be treated in the same way. In Python, polymorphism refers to the ability of different classes to define methods that have the same name but behave differently, depending on the object calling them. This can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In simple terms, polymorphism allows a single function or method to work in different ways based on the type of object or the number of arguments passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism helps in writing flexible and reusable code by allowing a common interface for different types of objects.\n",
    "- In Python, polymorphism is supported through method overriding, the ability of functions to take different types of arguments, and operator overloading.\n",
    "- Polymorphism provides the foundation for dynamic behavior, ensuring that objects behave according to their specific class implementations, even when accessed via a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Polymorphism:**\n",
    "- 1. Method Overriding: A child class can provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
    "- 2. Method Overloading: Python doesn't support method overloading directly (like Java or C++), but similar behavior can be achieved by defining default arguments or using variable-length arguments.\n",
    "- 3. Operator Overloading: Python allows you to change the behavior of built-in operators for user-defined types."
