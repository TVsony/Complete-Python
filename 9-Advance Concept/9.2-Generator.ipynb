    "#### Generators in Python\n",
    "A generator in Python is a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over data without storing it in memory. Generators provide a convenient way to create iterators using functions and the yield keyword. They are useful when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences, as they generate values on the fly (lazy evaluation) rather than precomputing and storing all values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike regular functions, which use return to return a value and terminate the function, generators use yield to produce a value and pause execution, retaining the state of the function so it can be resumed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics of Generators:**\n",
    "- **Lazy Evaluation:** Values are generated one at a time, on demand, reducing memory usage.\n",
    "- **State Retention:** Generators remember their state (e.g., local variables) between successive calls.\n",
    "- **Single Use:** Generators can only be iterated once. After all items are produced, they are exhausted."
